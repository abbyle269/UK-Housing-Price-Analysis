<h2 align="left">Download Dataset</h2>

###

<h5 align="left">1.	Link to download the main dataset UK Housing Prices 1995- 2023 (4GB)</h5>

###

<p align="left">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lorentzyeung/price-paid-data-202304/data (Kaggle)<br>In this project, I only focus within the timeframe of 2019 to 202, so I run this Python Script on the 4GB csv file to download the dataset from 2019 â€“ 2023. However, to easily upload the csv file to MS SQL, I also need to reduce the size so I divide the file into 3 csv files. Original dataset has 16 columns, drop out 4 columns to become 12 columns, reduce one csv 4 GB to 3 csv files as MSSQL not allow to upload file over 300 KB. <br><br>Note: you can use another environment to normalize the data like Google Colab, etc, but for convenience, Kaggle will allow bigdata file uploads without setup time.<br>https://github.com/letuthieny/UK-House-Price/tree/main/Kaggle%20-%20Python%20file <br><br>Or you can skip this Python step and download directly 3 CSV files from <br>Link: https://github.com/letuthieny/UK-House-Price/tree/main/CSV%20Files</p>
